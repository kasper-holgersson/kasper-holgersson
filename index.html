                <h2>Kasper Holgersson</h2>
                <p>I am a student at NTI Gymnasiet in Uppsala where I have studied a high school technical program and now I am <br>
                   taking a fourth year where im studying to be a high school software engineer. During my free time I play video games <br>
                   and edit youtube videos using Premier Pro. I tend to pick up things quickly whether that's a programming language or <br> 
                   learning edit youtube videos. I work fast but also efficient and I am creative with lots of ideas floating in my head <br>
                   all the time.
